# Running locally & Debugging

Now that your app is ready, is time to run. This is where we can test and check for possible errors (via debug). And check for tips & tricks.

## Using the sample

The next section will show you how to run your app. When it opens on the browser, click on **New Bucket** to create your bucket (the name should be unique across all Forge accounts). Right-click on the newly created bucket and choose **Upload file** (this triggers the OSS Upload process). Then expand the bucket tree node and right-click on the file, select **Translate** (This triggers the Model Derivative JOB). After a moment your file should be ready, click again on the file to show it on the Viewer.
