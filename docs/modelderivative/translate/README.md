# Translate the file

The Model Derivative API enables users to represent and share their designs in different formats, as well as to extract valuable metadata.

Not sure if your files are compatible? Check the [supported translations](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/supported-translations/).

At this section, let's call [POST Job](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/job-POST/) to start the translation process. Note that this endpoint is asynchronous and initiates a process that runs in the background, rather than keeping an open HTTP connection until completion. 

Choose your language: [NodeJS](modelderivative/translate/nodejs) | [.NET](modelderivative/translate/net) | [Go](modelderivative/translate/go) | [PHP](modelderivative/translate/php) | [Java](modelderivative/translate/java)
