# OAuth 2-legged

In formal OAuth terminology, to accomplish **two-legged** authentication on the Forge Platform requires that you use the “Client Credentials” grant type.

This means that your app directly communicates with the Forge Platform for authentication and accessing resources. If it’s a web app, the end user is not directly aware of any of these server-to-server communications, as none of it is passed through the web browser.

Authentication is required for accessing any resource on Forge. A **2-legged** token grant access to your application information.
